# Neovim Configuration

This is the latest configuration for NeoVim using manjaro linux. Currently have some shortcuts set for code actions and debugging code.

### To Do

1. Rewrite the lspconfig from scratch once again (this is meant to work with nvim-cmp).
    Go to this dotfile for inspiration:https://github.com/nithinbekal/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim/init.lua
2. Rewrite lualine for the status line (lualine.nvim and trouble.nvim works together).
3. Modify for using code actions straight from the lsp (probably not necessary).
4. Rewrite possible diagnostics (they are mentioned within the nvim-lsp).
    - This may require correction due to the fact that trouble.nvim works for checking errors.
